# Random Custom MAC Changer

This tool allows you to generate and set random MAC addresses on your network interfaces with customizable options.


!** IMPORTANT NOTICE **!

This MAC changer script can be a helpful tool, but it's important to use it for good purposes. Here's why:

* **Disrupting Networks:** Changing your MAC address can temporarily disconnect you from the network. It takes time for devices to recognize the new address.
* **Security Concerns:** Some networks rely on MAC addresses for security. Changing yours might violate the network's terms or make it less secure.

**Before using this script, consider if there's a legitimate reason to change your MAC address. Here are some good reasons:**

* **Virtual Machines:** Setting up a virtual machine with a unique MAC address helps with isolation. 
* **Troubleshooting:** Testing network behavior with different MAC addresses can be useful (with proper permissions).
* **Authorized Networks:** Using a disposable or authorized MAC address on a specific network might be allowed (with network admin permission).

**If you're unsure about the implications, consult with a network administrator or IT professional.**

**By proceeding, you acknowledge that you'll use this script responsibly and ethically.**
